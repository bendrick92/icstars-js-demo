# IC Stars JS/React Demos

This repository is a collection of excercises/demos for the IC Stars/Milwaukee Tool presentation.

There are a series of Javascript-specific exercises designed to give an overview of the basics of using plain JS and HTML to:

* Parse and display data
* Process user input
* Dynamically change content

## /pets

This is a basic HTML + Javascript page that simply loads some static data and displays it on the webpage.

## /build-a-burger

This is a slightly more complex HTML + Javascript page. It allows the user to enter some input and has a few functional buttons.

## /car-customizer

This is a more advanced exercise that still uses HTML + Javascript, but involves more data. It also illustrates how Javascript can be leveraged to dynamically update the UI based on user input.

## /react-demo

This demo is a very basic React app. It simply loads randomized cat GIFs by making API requests.
